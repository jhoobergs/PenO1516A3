    <string name="text_defenders">Your main purpose is to defend the hidden base.
        The location of this hidden base wil be chosen by the team leader.
        You can defend your base by using the "defend" button when you are near an attacker.
        This wil send the attacker out to the perimeter of the map, which will buy your team some time and the attacker will also lose a life.
        In order to win the game, the defending team will have to accomplish a certain number of challenges.</string>
    <string name="text_attackers">Your main purpose is to find the hidden base of the defending team.
        When you enter the hidden base, you will grab hold of a digital flag.
        In order to win the game, you will have to bring this flag to the perimeter of the map.
        In order to make this a bit more challenging,
        the defending team will be aware of your location whilst holding the flag.
        If a defender kills you while holding the flag, the flag will respawn at the hidden location.
        Each attacker will start with three lives. The attacking team will also be able to accomplish challenges.
        They will be rewarded with special perks if they manage to complete these tasks. The attackers will have access to another feature that will allow them to see the defending team on their maps.
        In order to unlock this feature, you must been standing under a light source.
        Beware, cheating by the use of a flashlight will be detected!    </string>
